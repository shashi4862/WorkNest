Creating a Project using Hibernate, Spring MVC and JPA

We are building a WorkNest app where:
o) Admin adds users, allocates tasks, and tracks progress.
o) User views tasks, updates completion status, and can comment on work.
o) Hibernate ORM will manage persistence to the database.
o) Spring MVC + JSP/Servlets will serve the UI.

 Requirements (User Stories)
 Admin:
1. Can register/login/logout.
2. Can add users (CRUD operations).
3. Can allocate tasks to users with a start date and due date.
4. Can track all tasks on a dashboard:
-Pending
-In Progress
-Completed
-Delayed
1. Can see comments given by users on their tasks.
User:
1. Can register/login/logout.
2. Can view assigned tasks.
3. Can update status: In Progress / Completed.
4. Can add comments/reviews on tasks.
